# Welcome to Olivero Hugo Theme

We're excited to present a **1:1 replication** of Drupal's Olivero theme, now available for Hugo! This theme brings together the best of both worlds - Hugo's lightning-fast performance and Olivero's award-winning design.

## What Makes Olivero Special?

Olivero isn't just another theme. It represents a fundamental shift in how we think about web design and accessibility. Here's what sets it apart:

### 🎨 Modern Design System

The theme features a **vibrant blue color palette** balanced with neutral grays, creating a professional yet approachable appearance. Every element has been carefully crafted to provide visual hierarchy and guide user attention.

### ♿ Accessibility First

Built with **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** in mind, Olivero includes:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast ratios for text
- Focus indicators for interactive elements

### 📱 Mobile-First Responsive

Using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, the layout adapts seamlessly from mobile phones to desktop displays. The navigation system intelligently switches between mobile and desktop modes based on available space.

## Typography Excellence

The theme uses **Lora** for body text and **Metropolis** for headings, creating a perfect balance between readability and personality. With an 18px base font size and consistent line heights, content remains comfortable to read across all devices.

> "It is gorgeous, it looks amazing, and it's also by far the most accessible theme that we've ever shipped in the history of Drupal — something that we should be proud of."

> — Dries Buytaert, Drupal founder
